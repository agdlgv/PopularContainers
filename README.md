# Popular Containers
I needed a list of the 1000 most popular containers from docker hub for a project I am working on and couldn't find an easy way to do it, so I quickly wrote this `crappy shell scriptâ„¢` using the docker hub API.

## Running
This is just a simple bash script so just `chmod +x PopularContainers.sh` and then run
`./PopularContainers.sh`.
